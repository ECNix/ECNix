# About Me
I am a computer science major at Baylor University with a concentration in software engineering. I hope to find work in some form of application development after graduation in May 2025, as I find particular joy in building a program's infrastructure from the ground up. I am familiar with UML diagrams, and find domain models particularly enjoyable and useful to construct. I hope to one day be a software manager, as I am comfortable with positions of authority when I am given one. I am able to look at a project wholistically to make sure scope doesn't creep to high and determine the best path forward to meet the deadline with a high quality product. Of course, I shall need more experience in the field before assuming such a position.
